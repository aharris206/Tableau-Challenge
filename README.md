## Analysis
- For this assignment, I decided to work with a time range from the start of this bootcamp up to March 2023 (which was the most recent data avaliable)
- It seems that ridership has been slowly increasing with every passing month. This is likly due to the increasing amount of daylight hoursand the transition from Winter to Spring! ***note the slight dip in Februaryis due to the fact February has only 28 days as opposed to 31 of January and March***
- **Looking at rider statistics**, it is obvious that the majority of riders have a membership with the CitiBike Program and prefer the Classic Bike over the Electric Bike!
- **For CitiBike Members**, it seems that the bike station at W 21 & 6 Ave is the most popular station to leave from, being *somewhat* less popular amung casual riders.
- **As far as ride times go**, majority of bike rides seem to conclude in under 10 minutes, though there is still a sizable margin of rides that exceed 20 minutes!
